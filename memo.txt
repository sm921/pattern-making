vulkano = "0.23.0"
winit = "0.24"
vulkano-shaders = "0.23.0"
vulkano-win = "0.23.0"

note: use latest versions!

delete use Version

delete first arg
let instance = Instance::new(None, &required_extensions, None).unwrap();

use appropriate winit version. MAY NOT BE LATEST!!
let surface = WindowBuilder::new()
.build_vk_surface(&event_loop, instance.clone())
.unwrap();
-> code jump to build_vk_surface and check what is the correct WindowBuilder version vulkano-win uses.


Rust is really slow when it comes to compilation time
